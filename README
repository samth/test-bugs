Hello World.

Obviously, you should ask your self which world is it that you want to be greeting.  Is it really a good idea
to be doing such greeting to a world you might not know or a reality you don't want to be part of?  And if you
do restrict such greetings to worlds that you do participate in, there is not much sense in an element greeting
its container.

Yes, in fact, an element greeting its container is not only a form of self-awareness and -assurance, it
encompasses other entities in the same world.  We can therefore conclude that such greetings are a direct way
to improve your environmental awareness and feeling of oneness with the world around you.  The question is,
still, which meaning of "world" is fits best here?
